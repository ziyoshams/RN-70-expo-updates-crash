### Minimal reproducible demo for iOS
* Project is created with `npx react-native init`
* Uses `expo modules` with `expo-updates`
* `expo modules` is installed with `npx install-expo-modules@latest`
* Project builds successfully.
* App runs with `expo modules` installed, but crashes when `expo-updates` is installed. 
* The crash happens on `Release` build only. Debug runs fine.
